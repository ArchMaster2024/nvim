# Neovim Configuration

This is my personal neovim configuration, with this I and anyone can start to work
with neovim editor, you can use, share, modify and create your own version based on
this.

# Why I share my personal nvim config?

Because I can, just for that reason. And by I like to help others people who start with
this awesome and incredible editor, I want people can start with neovim without suffering
on the process of learn editor features and basic use, you can start with good config,
easy to adapting to your requirements, without the problem like 'Oh no, I don\'t have an
idea of how I leave from here', just type Esc key of your keyboard and Voila, you out of
nvim.

# How I can personalize this config?

Simple, just go to plugin dir for basic configs, lua for plugins and more advance settings
and other directories you learn what they do with the time, learn and with this repo, on the
documentation and wiki you search a lot of topics, like customization, how I split the files,
project structure, how colaborate and much more.
